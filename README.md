My attempt is to eventually create a system to simply and efficiently simulate and explore different choices to make in a game of Caverna. My goals are as follows:

1. Implement enough code to track and manage resources as they accumulate on action spaces
2. Implement the ability to allow for the random choosing of new action spaces as rounds progress
3. allow for the ability to build a game board and account for effects of tiles
